# HR Data Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

This project features a comprehensive HR Data Analysis Dashboard built in Microsoft Excel. The goal was to transform raw Human Resources dataâ€”such as employee demographics, performance metrics, compensation details, and attrition recordsâ€”into an interactive and visually intuitive reporting tool. This dashboard empowers HR management and stakeholders to quickly gain actionable insights into the workforce, enabling data-driven decision-making.

Project Objectives
The primary objectives for developing this HR Data Analysis Dashboard were:

Centralize Data Reporting: Create a single, accessible source for key HR metrics, eliminating the need to manually compile reports from disparate sources.
 
Enhance Data Visualization: Utilize Excel's charting and conditional formatting capabilities (e.g., pivot tables, pivot charts, slicers) to present complex data in an easy-to-digest visual format.

Drive Insight & Action: Provide interactive tools (like slicers and timelines) that allow users to filter data and perform detailed drill-downs, uncovering trends, anomalies, and areas for improvement in employee retention, performance management, and resource allocation.

Monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Track critical HR metrics like Attrition Rate, Headcount, Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) breakdowns, Average Salary by Department/Level, and Performance Distribution.

# Key Features

Interactive Controls: The dashboard incorporates Slicers and Timelines to allow dynamic filtering by department, job role, hire date, location, and other relevant dimensions.

KPI Scorecards: Prominent display of high-level summary metrics (KPIs) for immediate situational awareness.

Performance Analysis: Visualizations dedicated to showing the distribution of employee performance ratings and their correlation with tenure or compensation.

Attrition Deep Dive: Charts and tables that analyze attrition by various factors (e.g., department, manager, tenure, reason for leaving) to pinpoint retention risks.

Demographic Breakdown: Charts illustrating the composition of the workforce by age group, gender, and education level to support D&I initiatives.
Technical Scope

Tool: Microsoft Excel (Focus on advanced features like Power Query, Data Model, Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and DAX (if applicable for complex calculations)).

Data Source: Simulated or anonymized HR dataset (e.g., .csv or .xlsx file) containing essential employee-level attributes.

Methodology: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) principles were applied using Power Query (or standard Excel functions) to clean, standardize, and load the raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis. Data modeling techniques were used to ensure efficient linkage between tables (if multiple data sources were used).
